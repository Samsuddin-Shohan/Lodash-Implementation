# Lodash-Implementation
Here I  Implement the Lodash methods which makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. 
Here is defination of Methods:

Chunk-Creates an array of elements split into groups the length of size. If array can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

Compact - Creates an array with all falsey values removed. The values false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN are falsey.

Concat - Creates a new array concatenating array with any additional arrays and/or values.
