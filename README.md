# Lodash-Implementation
Here I  Implement the Lodash methods which makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. 

Here is defination of Methods:

Chunk-Creates an array of elements split into groups the length of size. If array can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

Compact - Creates an array with all falsey values removed. The values false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN are falsey.

Concat - Creates a new array concatenating array with any additional arrays and/or values.

Diffrence - Creates an array of array values not included in the other given arrays using SameValueZero for equality comparisons. The order and references of result values are determined by the first array.

DifferenceBy - This method is like Difference except this methods can take Floating number as array elements.This methos also take a function (Math.floor,Math.ceil) as arguments;

DifferenceWith - This method is like Difference except it takes array of objects as arguments.

Drop - Creates a slice of array with n elements dropped from the beginning.

DropRight - Creates a slice of array with n elements dropped from the end.
